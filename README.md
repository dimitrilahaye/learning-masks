# Learning masks

## Why

The only times my 15-year-old son asks me for help with his revision is when he needs to learn a map or blank text.

So I imagined Learning Masks so that he could be a little more independent.

## How

### Step 1
Go to [Leaning Masks](https://dimitrilahaye.github.io/learning-masks/) page

### Step 2
Upload an image

### Step 3
Draw zones around the concepts you want to learn

### Step 4
Challenge yourself and reveal the zones one by one to see if you learned your lesson
